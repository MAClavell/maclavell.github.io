				<h2> Summary </h2>
				<p>
				<i>DIE-PARTISAN</i> is a modern twin-stick, overhead shooter that takes place in a heaven-like world, where Lucifer has been raised from hell to clear rogue angels from heaven. You play as Lucifer, in a seemingly growing world of infinite enemies where some angels have gone haywire. Your job is to bust through the angel forces as quickly as possible, and rack up the highest score whilst staying alive. <i>DIE-PARTISAN</i> claims a similar goal from games like Pac-Man, Space-Invaders, etc: to eliminate the most enemies, and survive for the longest period of time. While there is no distinct “ending” to the game, the goal has remained throughout development to be a competitive score-based game.

				<h2> Development </h2>
				<p>
				The full git repository for <i>DIE-PARTISAN</i> is located <a href="https://github.com/MAClavell/DIE-PARTISAN" target="_blank">here.</a>
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>DIE-PARTISAN</i> was developed over the course of four months during early 2017. The game runs on the Monogame engine, an open-source game engine for C#.
				</p>
				<p>
				An external tool was created for the game. Its purpose is to be able to create binary, csv-like “.cmap” files that can be used for easy and fast map-creation. Maps in the game are generated from smaller, individual maps that are created through the editor, so this tool allows to users to easily create and add levels to the map creation pool to allow for more random and diverse gameplay. The tool allows for the creation of spawn points, walls, and enemies, and has drag-draw capabilities as well as eraser and clear tools. Importing and exporting .cmap files works, as well as being able to edit imported files and save over older ones.
				</p>
				<p>
				The development team consists of four people:
				<ul>
					<li>Michael Clavell - Team Lead</li>
					<li>Dan Giame - Architect</li>
					<li>Ben Stern - Designer</li>
					<li>Ben Stern - UI/External tool</li>
				</ul>
