                This game was created as an experimental mix between analog and digital games in Unity3D. 
                The players take turns passing a mobile device around to select their actions, then gather around as it all plays out. 
                My list of tasks was less on the programming side for once (we all need breaks!) and included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Created sound effects.</li>
                    <li>Composed a background music track that varies based on the gameplay.</li>
